# Exercise 94: Random Password. solved 33 lines
#  Write a function that generates a random password. The password should have a random length of between 7 and 10
#  characters. Each character should be randomly selected from positions 33 to 126 in the ASCII table. Your function
#  will not take any parameters. It will return the randomly generated password as its only result. Display the randomly
#  generated password in your fileâ€™s main program. Your main program should only run when your solution has not been
#  imported into another file.
# Hint: You will probably find the chr function helpful when completing this exercise. Detailed information
# about this function is available online.
from random import randint

# this function generates random password from characters with positions 33 to 126 in the ASCII table
# with random length between 7 and 10 characters

    #     sign = chr(randint(33, 126))
    #     password = password + sign
    while len(password) < password_lengh:  # loop runs until number of characters in password equal to password length
        sign = chr(randint(33, 126))  # in loop it is generated random characters with positions 33 to 126 in ASCII
        password = password + sign  # randomly chosen character concatenated to the password
