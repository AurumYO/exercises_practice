## respond with a message that says hello to the user, using his or her name
#name = input("Please enter your name here: ")

##Ex.3: Area of a Room. Program asks user enter the width and length of a room.
## program should compute and display the area of the room.
## The length and the width will be entered as floating point numbers. Include
#units in your prompt and output message; either feet or meters, depending on which
#unit you are more comfortable working with.

##Ex4: Area of a Field. Create a program that reads the length and width of a farmerâ€™s field from the user in
##feet. Display the area of the field in acres.
#f_length = int(input("Please enter the length of the farmer's field in feet: "))
#f_width = int(input("Please enter the width of the farmer's field in feet: "))

##Ex5: Bottle Deposits. drink containers holding one liter or less have a $0.10 deposit, and drink containers
# holding more than one liter have a $0.25 deposit. Write a program that reads the number of containers of each size from the user.
# Your program should continue by computing and displaying the refund that will be
# received for returning those containers. Format the output so that it includes a dollar
# sign and always displays exactly two decimal places.
#cont_small = int(input("Enter the number of small drink containers you want to return (1 liter or less): "))

##Exercise 6: Tax and Tip. The program will begin by reading the cost of a meal from the user.
# Then program will compute the tax and tip for the meal (22% tax rate, tip as 18% percent of the meal (without the taxa).
# The output from program should include the tax amount, the tip amount, and the grand total for
#the meal including both the tax and the tip. Format the output so that all of the values displayed using two decimal places.
#meal = float(input("Enter the cost of your meal: "))

#tip = (meal - tax) * 0.18
#gr_total = meal + tax + tip
#print("Your meal cost: {0:1.2f} for the meal, plus {1:1.2f} fof tax, plus {2:1.2f} of tips.And the Grand total for the meal is {3:1.2f}"

##Ex7: Sum of the First n Positive Integers.Write a program that reads a positive integer, n, from the user and displays the
##sum of all of the integers from 1 to n. The sum of the first n positive integers can be computed using the formula:
## s = ((n *(n+1))/2
#n = int(input("Please enter positive integer: "))
#s = int(((n)*(n+1))/2)
#print("The sum of all integers from 1 to",n,"is",s,".")

##Ex8: Widgets and Gizmos. retailer sells two products: widgets and gizmos. Each widget weighs 75 gr.
## each gizmo weighs 112 gr. Write a program that reads the number of widgets and gizmos in an order from the user.
## Then program should compute and display the total weight of the order.
#widgets = int(input("Please enter the number of Widgets you'd like to order: "))
#gizmos = int(input("Please enter the number of Gizmos you'd like to order: "))
#weight_widgets = widgets * 75
#weight_gizmos = gizmos * 112
#tot_order = weight_widgets + weight_gizmos
#print("The total weight of your order  is",tot_order,"grams")

##Ex9:Compound Interest. Pretend you have just opened a new savings account that earns 4% per year. Interest  you earn is
##paid at the end of the year, and is added to the balance of the savings account. Write a program that begins by reading
##the amount of money deposited into the account from the user. Then your program should compute and display the amount
##in the savings account after 1, 2, and 3 years. Display each amount so that it is rounded to 2 decimal places.
#deposit = float(input("Please enter the amount of the deposit you would like to place under 4% per year: "))
#interest = 1.04
#savacc_y1 = deposit * interest
#savacc_y2 = savacc_y1 * interest
#savacc_y3 = savacc_y2 * interest
#print("The balance of your savings account as of the end of the first year will be {0:1.2f}".format(savacc_y1))
#print("The balance of your savings account as of the end of the second year will be {0:1.2f}".format(savacc_y2))
#print("The balance of your savings account as of the end of the third year will be {0:1.2f}".format(savacc_y3))

##Ex10: Arithmetic. Create program that reads two int, a and b, from user. program should compute and display:
##The sum of a and b
##The difference when b is subtracted from a
##The product of a and b
##The quotient when a is divided by b
##The remainder when a is divided by b
##The result of log10 a
