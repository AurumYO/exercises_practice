# Ex 121: Count the Elements (Solvedâ€”49 Lines)
# Pythonâ€™s standard library includes a method named count that determines how many times specific value occurs in list.
# In this exercise, you will create a new function named countRange which determines and returns the number of elements
# within a list that are greater than or equal to some minimum value and less than some maximum value. Your function
# will take three parameters: the list, the minimum value and the maximum value. It will return an integer result
# greater than or equal to 0. Include a main program that demonstrates your function for several different lists,
# minimum and maximum values. Ensure that your program works correctly for both lists of integers and lists of floating
# point numbers.


# function takes list of integers, min and max value, and counts how many elements in the list are >= min and <= max
def count_range(user_list, min_value, max_value):
    # when function starts running counter is 0
    counter = 0
    # function runs through all list and compares each element to minimal and maximal value
    for n in user_list:
        # if element in the list is greater or equal to min value of smaller or equal to max value, counter increased
        if min_value <= n <= max_value:
            counter += 1
    # function returns number of elements which greater or equal to min value of smaller or equal to max value
    return counter


# the main function demonstrates counter_range function performance
