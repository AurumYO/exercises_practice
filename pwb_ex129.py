# Exercise 129: Two Dice Simulation (Solvedâ€”42 Lines)
#In this exercise you will simulate 1,000 rolls of two dice. Sample output is below:
# Total      Simulated percentage           Expected percentage
#  2                 2.90                         2.78


# function that simulates rolling a pair of six-sided dice. Function will not take any parameters.
# It returns the total that was rolled on two dice as its only result

    from random import randint
    x, y = randint(1, 6), randint(1, 6)
    return x + y


# Main program that uses dice_roll function to simulate rolling two six-sided dice 1,000 times.
# It counts the number of times that each total occurs. Then it should display a table that summarizes this data.
# Express the frequency for each total as  a percentage of the total number of rolls.
# Your program should also display the percentage expected by probability theory for each total
