# Exercise 48: Chinese Zodiac. Solvedâ€”35 Lines) The Chinese zodiac assigns animals to years in a 12 year cycle. One 12
# year cycle is shown in the table below. The pattern repeats from there, with 2012 being another year of the dragon,
# and 1999 being another year of the hare.
# Write a program that reads a year from the user and displays the animal associated with that year. Your program
# should work correctly for any year greater than or equal to zero, not just the ones listed in the table.
print("This program defines what Chinese zodiac year is.")
# Ask for user input
year = int(input("Please enter the year here: "))
# Define the year according to Chinese zodiac sign
base = (year - 2000) % 12
